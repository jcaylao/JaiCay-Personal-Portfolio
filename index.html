            <h1>Jaira Caylao</h1>
            <h3>UX UI Designer + Front End Developer</h3>
            <p>I am a recent graduate from University of California San Diego, with a major in Cognitive Science focusing on Design & Interaction and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>I have hands-on experience leading and collaborating with teams, bringing strong problem-solving and organizational skills into my design process.
                With a foundation in coding and experience in tools like Figma, I follow a user-centered design process to ensure I create thoughtful and effective solutions with the user in mind.
                This design process includes: conducting user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing.
                I'm passionate about designing user-friendly digital experiences, to make them easy to use and navigate in order to meet real user needs.
            </p>
            <p>During my free time, I like to crochet while binge-watching my current favorite shows, playing video games, and spending time with friends & family.</p>
